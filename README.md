Simple Blockchain ApplicationThis project implements a simple blockchain application based on the "Project Specification" document. It uses Laravel 12 for the backend API, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and ReactJS for the frontend. The entire application is containerized using Docker.Project OverviewThe application demonstrates the core principles of blockchain technology:Immutability: Blocks, once mined, are secured by cryptographic hashes. Tampering with a block breaks the chain.Transparency: All blocks and transactions on the chain are viewable.Integrity: A simplified Proof-of-Work (PoW) system ensures that adding new blocks requires computational effort. A validation mechanism checks the integrity of the entire chain.Tech StackBackend: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.3)Frontend: ReactJS (Vite)Database: PostgreSQL 15Containerization: Docker & Docker ComposeFeaturesTransaction Creation: Users can create new "pending" transactions (Sender, Receiver, Amount).Block Mining: A "Mine Block" feature groups all pending transactions, performs a simplified PoW (hash must start with "00"), and adds a new, valid block to the chain.Genesis Block: The system automatically creates a "Genesis Block" (Block #0) if the chain is empty.Blockchain Validation: A "Validate Chain" feature checks two things for every block:That its previous_hash matches the current_hash of the block before it.That its own current_hash is a valid hash of its contents (index, timestamp, transactions, nonce, previous hash).Ledger View: The frontend displays all blocks and their associated transactions.Status Dashboard: The UI shows the current validity status of the blockchain.How to Run (with Docker)PrerequisitesDockerDocker ComposeInstallation & SetupClone the Repository:git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
Prepare Laravel .env file:Navigate to the backend directory and copy the example environment file.cd backend
cp .env.example .env
The default .env is already configured to work with the docker-compose.yml database service (db, blockchain, sail, password).Prepare React .env file:Navigate to the frontend directory and create a .env file:cd ../frontend
echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api" > .env
Build and Run Containers:From the root project directory:docker-compose up -d --build
Install Laravel Dependencies & Run Migrations:Once the containers are running, exec into the app container to finalize setup.# Install composer dependencies
docker-compose exec app composer install

# Generate Laravel application key
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate

# Run database migrations
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
